Questions we need answered about some of the fields:

    *shapefiles for beat, district, sector?
    *for geo coords, double check we have the correct SRID (2264)

inmain

    can we get any more info about the cases from the case_id? (case_id: case number, if a report is generated from the call)
    callsources: E911, ALARM self-explanatory, but SELF, PHONE and RADIO?
    *primeunit: what are the responsibilities of the primary unit?
    service is always LAW, agency is always DPD
    nature/naturecode: differences between HANG UP, HANG UP WIRELESS PHASE 1, and HANG UP WIRELESS PHASE 2?
    *notes: need abbreviations used, can maybe get some of them from the nature codes
    *meanings of closecodes? (incilog as well)
    how is priority determined?
    *timeline of events: dispatch -> enroute -> arrive -> transport (optional) -> clear -> closed ?
    why are there dots outside the durham area?
    

incilog
    *what are the "transactions" in this table?
    each unit = one officer? any additional info we can get from unitper table, such as officer pay to more accurately estimate cost?

lwmain
    why does lwmainid have duplicate values? (498659, 503578, 521324)
    inci_id doesn't function as a foreign key (ex. there are values of inci_id in lwmain that don't exist in inmain, some pre 2014) -- why?
    lwchrgid -- what is the "offense" table?
    *data only corresponds to calls from january/february -- can we get the rest of this data/does it exist?
    

    *which code (code_fbi, code_sbi, code_agcy) is the one corresponding to the csstatus foreign key? (assuming code_agcy) are any columns other than descriptn informative?
        assuming "code_agcy" for all since that matches up best with the data (lwmain.csstatus)

    same questions for lwmain.emdivision, emsection, emunit, invststats, premise, weapon
