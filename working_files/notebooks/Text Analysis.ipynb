With the current tension between police and citizens across the US, using the call comments to identify these kinds of calls could be useful to the DPD.  We can take two approaches to identifying these calls: using a regex to find words in close proximity (such as \"OFFICER\" and \"RUDE\" in the same sentence), or performing sentiment analysis on the comments.  We'll try both the ANEW and AFINN dictionaries."
